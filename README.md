the plan was to post it yesterday but there were a lot of issues I fixed them today tbh it was a challenging project but i did it🤟🔥

Connect Four Game 🔥

Built with TypeScript ⚡️🔥

Features: 

✅ Play with computer 

✅ It will wait 15sec to allow players to think .. then it will turn to the next player

✅ You can quit, pause, continue, and restart the game

✅ Cool animations 

✅ Cool bg music

Game Rules:

🔹 When you click on a circle, it won't get painted immediately Instead, the disc will drop to the lowest available spot in the column because the game counts the discs column by column to determine a win.

🔹 The first player to connect 4 discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
